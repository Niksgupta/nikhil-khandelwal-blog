description: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus. A coronavirus is a type of virus. As a group, coronaviruses are common across the world. Generally, coronavirus can cause more severe symptoms in people with weakened immune systems, older people, and those with long term conditions like diabetes, cancer and chronic lung disease.

Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing.

## Disease origin

Originally, scientists believed the virus may have developed in bats, and later pangolins. On December 31 of last year, Chinese authorities alerted the World Health Organization of an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus causing severe illness, which was subsequently named SARS-CoV-2. As of April 11, 2020, nearly 1569456 COVID-19 cases have been documented, although many more mild cases have likely gone undiagnosed.
